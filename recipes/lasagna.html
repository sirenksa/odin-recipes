    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base.</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the meat sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>To assemble the lasagna:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Put pasta water on to boil:</h4>
            Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) 
            on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come 
            to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps 
            while the water is heating.</li>
        <li>
            <h4>Brown the ground beef:</h4>
            In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
                
                Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.
        
                </li>

    </ol>
